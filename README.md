PubertyPal

Kids begin undergoing major changes in their body, due to puberty, between the ages 9 and 15 (for boys) and 7 and 13 (for girls). It has become quite a common phenomenon for them to feel insecure and alone when all these sudden changes occur.

Many a times, they don’t know who to consult to or talk to within their own family as parents can tend to avoid answering questions which they deem to be awkward and uncomfortable. As a result, these young impressionable minds, can be afraid to feel comfortable in their own body.

PubertyPal is an app that is aimed at resolving these issues. It answers all the questions that a young mind could have regarding their changing bodies. It provides reassurance and comfort while conversing. PubertyPal also provides with prior-preparatory information that can be put to good use by the users to get ready or if they’re experiencing early changes (which is completely normal and okay).
